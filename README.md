_Please consider supporting my work_ if you _learn from it_ or _use it in your apps_. Everyone who does this is _paying it forward_ to those who can't afford to send me even a single, sad, solitary dollar. They get the resource for free so they can _change their life_, and _you_ get to _feel GREAT_ about it!

You can give me a buck or two or whatever you feel like at this link:
